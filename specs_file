first
$ gcc -dumpspecs > specs

then 
$ ln specs /cross_tools/lib/gcc/x86_64-lfs-linux-relibc/9.2.0/specs

add to the `cpp:` target

	-I/cross_tools/include -I/cross_tools/usr/include

so we have something like this:
	*cpp:
	%{posix:-D_POSIX_SOURCE} %{pthread:-D_REENTRANT} -I/cross_tools/include -I/cross_tools/usr/include

we then go to `*startfile:`
and replace crt1.o with /cross_tools/usr/lib/crt0.o and add /cross_tools/usr/lib/ to crti.o and crtn.o and remove the %s from all of them

also replace /cross_tools/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 with /cross_tools/lib/ld64.so.1

in cc1 part remove all the -fPIC thing and add -fPIE at the end
